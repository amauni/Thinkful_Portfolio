				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Three years ago I was asked to put together a website for a friend. Being knowledgeable in graphic design, and having a keen eye due to my experience in the fashion industry, I assumed it would be a piece of cake. I was wrong. I was unable to genuinely convey the illustrious ideas that were in my head, but I was also genuinely intrigued about how to get better!</p>
        <p> From that moment I realized that while I love being a fashionista, I also love tech! My goal is that my journey here as a <i>Thinkful</i> student will allow me to merge the two.</p>
